I am a third-year PhD student in the Applied Economics and Management program at Cornell University, whose research interests lie at the intersection of development, industrial organization, and agricultural economics. Broadly, my research examines how policy and market dynamics shape firm behavior, farmer beliefs, and economic outcomes in developing economies.
